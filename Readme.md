## RAML 2 code fixtures

This project contains the fixtures used to test the generators contained on raml2code

We use (https://github.com/fge/json-schema-validator)[fge/json-schema-validator] Schema validator because there a bunch
of json schema validator in javascript (https://github.com/Muscula/json-schema-benchmark)[json-schema-benchmark] but
neither works as expected.

In the future we want to integrate (https://github.com/json-schema/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite)[JSON-Schema-Test-Suite]
